My PhD project:
# Involving citizens and professionals<br>in research on ageing and health

**Overarching aim**:
* The overarching aim is to increase the understanding of the involvement<br>of
professionals and citizens in research on ageing and health; 

  + how such efforts are perceived;
  + how professional know-how and citizens’ ways of knowing could contribute<br>to the knowledge development in research on ageing and health. 

* An additional overarching ambition is to gain insights of the potential and pitfalls<br>of various participatory approaches and thereby contribute to the methodological development in the field.

* The there is an outspoken aim that the person engaged in research should be <br>actively part of (and thus able to influence) the process  of conducting research, <br>not just a passive object being studied by the researcher(s).

* Rather than either or it is a grey scale where it is difficult to draw the exact boundary of where someone is actively participating in a research process.

# Why involve citizens and professionals in research?

# Involving citizens and professionals in research<br>has to do with...

### I. Public Administration<sup>1</sup>/ Democracy

To whom do we leave to...
* describe the needs of older people?
* decide on priorities in research and societal development?

### II. Production/ Innovation

--

#### Universities:
* produce knowledge and innovations linked to 'real-world problems'

--

#### Citizens and professionals:
* facing 'real-world problems'
* recruited as (potential) 'users' to provide feedback or co-create <br>the knowledge/ innovations being produced 

--

#### Complex 'real-world problems': 
* typically ill-defined
* 'wicked' in nature
* require a plethora of perspectives, and thus collaborative efforts

# So... what is the knowledge gap?

---

# More knowledge needed related to...

#### The power balance between researcher(s) and the participants
* Risks of reproducing existing inequalities rather than addressing them (Buffel, 2015)
* Potential for unjust exercises of power (Hickey & Mohan, 2004) 

--

#### The methods/methodologies to use in order to... 
  + convert expressed concerns and ideas into proper research questions (Erdtman et al., 2012).
  + appropriately recruit representatives (Gradinger et al., 2015)
  + adequately involve users in data collection (Priestley et al., 2010) and in the analysis of
the findings (Cotterell, 2008). 

--

####  And overall there is... 
* a scarcity of studies about involving various user groups, including citizens and professionals, in ageing and health research
(Kylberg et al., 2018).

# Study I

---

**Study I** explored the wicked problem of providing accessible housing for the ageing population in Sweden, with a specific focus on the identification of critical aspects in decision-making, using the Research Circle methodology and deductively applying a framework from transdisciplinary science.

# Study II

---

Study II investigates the awareness of and attitudes towards public involvement in research on ageing and health among 60+ citizens in Sweden, through a survey analysed descriptively and through multivariable regression analysis.

---

class: inverse, center, middle, navy-slide

# Study III

---

Study III inquires how senior citizens in Sweden experience being involved in a mass experiment targeting housing accessibility, applying a mixed method approach.

---

class: inverse, center, middle, navy-slide

# Study IV

---

Study IV elucidates potentials and pitfalls related to the establishment and maintenance of mechanisms for involving professionals and citizens in the context of a research centre for ageing research, through an abductive qualitative analysis of documents and interviews.
